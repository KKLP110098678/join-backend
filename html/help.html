            Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
            project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what
            Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
          </div>
          What is Join? <br />
          Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
          group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp
          at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
          "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
          work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages
          the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
          in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that Join
          is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
          extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
          user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
          reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
          <br />How to use it <br />Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
          Join: <br />
          1. Exploring the Board When you log in to Join, you'll find a default
          board. This board represents your project and contains four default
          lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done". <br />
          2. Creating Contacts In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on
          your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact",
          and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
          be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
          <br />
          3. Adding Cards Now that you've added your contacts, you can start
          adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button
          under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task
          details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
          etc. <br />
          4. Moving Cards As the task moves from one stage to another, you can
          reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
          list to another. <br />
          5.Deleting Cards Once a task is completed, you can either move it to
          the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove
          it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
          this action is irreversible. Remember that using Join effectively
          requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
          reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions about
          Join? Feel free to contact us at [Your Contact Email]. We're here to
          help you!
